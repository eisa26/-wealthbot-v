# Introduction

### We love pull requests! 
First off, thank you for considering contributing to wealthbot.io. It's people like you that can help bring wealth management to the masses.

### Guidelines
Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

### Contributions
wealthbot.io is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community — you! There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into wealthbot.io itself.

### Never contributed to open source before? Go here
Here are a couple of friendly tutorials: http://makeapullrequest.com/ and http://www.firsttimersonly.com/

At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first.

If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.

# Getting started
### How to submit a contribution
For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix:

1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Do the changes in your fork
3. Send a pull request indicating that you have a CLA on file.

### Small fixes
Small contributions such as fixing spelling errors, where the content is small enough to not be considered intellectual property, can be submitted by a contributor as a patch, without a CLA.

As a rule of thumb, changes are obvious fixes if they do not introduce any new functionality or creative thinking. As long as the change does not affect functionality, some likely examples include the following:

* Spelling / grammar fixes
* Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
* Comment clean up
* Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants
* Adding logging messages or debugging output
* Changes to ‘metadata’ files like Gemfile, .gitignore, build scripts, etc.
* Moving source files from one directory or package to another

# How to report a bug
If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email gene@wealthbot.io instead.

In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:

* Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
* Can I disable something for other people?

If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email us at gene@wealthbot.io.

### How to file a bug report
File an issue here on Github. When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

1. What version of PHP and Symfony are you using?
2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
3. What did you do?
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?

General questions should go to hi@wealthbot.io instead of the issue tracker. We'll do our best to answer or ask you to file an issue if you've tripped over a bug.

# How to suggest a feature or enhancement
Do you have a feature you’d like to see? We’d love to hear your ideas for improving wealthbot.io!

Please use [our public roadmap on Trello](https://trello.com/b/klhsT5Xj/wealthbot-io-roadmap-and-ideas) for feature requests.

Before making your feature requests, double-check our Backlog list and the 'In Progress' list to the right. If a feature is already there, we've captured it and we’re on it—no need to reach out. Feel free to subscribe to the card to track our progress.

Don’t see your feature listed already? Then get in touch! You can comment on this card or send an email to hi@wealthbot.io, and someone on our team will take a look. Be sure to let us know the following info:

* What is the pain point that the feature is trying to address?
* What would it do that isn’t already in the app?
* How would you or other users benefit from the feature?


# Code review process
At this point you're waiting on us. We like to at least comment on pull requests within three business days (and, typically, one business day). We may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* Write tests.
* Write a good commit message.
